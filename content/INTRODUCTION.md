## An Introduction to HTML

HTML is the language that the Web is built on. Whatever programming languages that websites used, they are ultimately integrated into HTML. Even if you don't pursue a career in programming, you can still find many uses for learning the language. You can use your HTML skills to format a blog post, tweak an email template, or create your own website.  

This course introduces you to the language of the web. You will learn how to customize text, embed videos and images to a website, and use other languages with HTML. Hopefully, by the end of the lesson, you'll be able to build your own website.
